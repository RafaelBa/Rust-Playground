CSV reader
==========
This project is to try Rust by reading a file, interpreting the CSV format and giving back a collection of values.
As I move forward in learning Rust this should be refactored and improved on the way.

Reading the file, parsing the CSV to a struct value and kicking it off with the tests in order to print something to console. Note that the tests don't test anything here.

As CSV file data (/resources/EWR_Ortsteile_2012_12-31.csv) I use [data](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/regionales/kleinraumdaten/ortsteileOD.asp?Kat=6101) (from 12/2012) from [Statistik Berlin Brandenburg](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/regionales/kleinraumdaten/ortsteileOD.asp?Kat=6101).
The data is published under the [creative commons by 3.0 DE](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/de/) and was not changed or mixed.
